# long.

# Your new company has a list of figures saved in a list. THe issue is that
# these numbers have no separator. The numbers are saved in teh following
# format: [1000000, 2356989, 2354672, 9878098]. Write a function called
# convert_numbers for readability that takes the numbers in a list and
# convert them into a string. The returned list should be [ '1,000,000',
# '2,356,989', '2,354,672', '9,878,098â€™].
