## Why solve challenges?

A programmerâ€™s job is to write code to solve problems. When you solve
a challenge, not only do you get to cement your knowledge, but you
master the invaluable skill of finding solutions to problems. Solving
challenges helps you think. By solving challenges, you get to see how
your code can solve real-life situations that programmers face.

## Problem Statements

 Problems requirements are in the form of comments in each day's challenge respective to
 their .py file. There 2 challenges each day, one is easier than the other.

## Additional challenges

In order to further improve upon my understanding of Python and the tools the
language provides. I will give myself additional challenges by using list
comprehensions, lambda functions, generator expressions, etc, and will try using
functional programming whenever possible. I will try to revisit my previous
solutions from time to time to implement new techniques whenever I learn about
them.
