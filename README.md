50 Days of Python - A Challenge A Day by Benjamin Bennett Alexander

# Why Solve challenges?
A programmerâ€™s job is to write code to solve problems. When you solve
a challenge, not only do you get to cement your knowledge, but you
master the invaluable skill of finding solutions to problems. Solving
challenges helps you think. By solving challenges, you get to see how
your code can solve real-life situations that programmers face.

# Problem Statements
 Problems are in the form of comments in each day's challenge respective to their .py file.
